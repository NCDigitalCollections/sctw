She tells him that some of the children are sick. The corn, sweet potato, and Irish potato crops look good and Thomas is helping her plow. She wishes Francis was home so that they would have more to eat and she wouldn&#39;t have to work when she was unable to do so. Their new daughter is four weeks old and still needs a name; she includes cutout of the baby girl&#39;s hand on a separate piece of paper. She tells about some local people including wounded soldiers and a man who deserted and was sent back. His mother has visited her recently. She tells Francis not to vote for Vance but instead to vote for Holden. She worries about Francis, and tells him she cannot keep working as hard as she has to without him at home. She complains about the price of thread and cotton.",,"Corn; Cotton; Sweet potatoes; Family farms; Money--Confederate States of America; United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865; United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Correspondence; United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Children; United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Desertions; United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Health aspects; United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Food supply;  North Carolina--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Sources; United States--History--Civil War, 1861-1865--Women; Women--North Carolina; Voting",,,,,,"Poteet-Dickson Letters, 1861-1902.
